## NUCLEO_F446ZE wave form generation and analysis ##

This is a steadily growing project that I am using demonstrate my embedded capabilities while teaching myself a few new tricks. See the projects Wiki section for more documentation. 

Todo List:
1. Generate a Sine Wave using the DAC
2. Generate a Sine Wave using a DMA
3. Read back the generated Sine Wave using a ADC with DMA
4. Integrate Debug tools that can help capture large pieces of analog data
5. Analyze the waveform and produce statistics including the RMS, Peak-To-Peak, and Frequency, Period, and Offset.
7. Add Unit Testing and create action in Git Hub pipeline
8.
